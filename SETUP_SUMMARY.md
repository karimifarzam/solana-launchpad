# Testnet Setup Summary for Apple Silicon

## 🚀 Quick Start

Your Solana Launchpad project is now configured for testnet deployment! Here's what we've set up:

### ✅ What's Ready

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - `env.testnet` - Testnet environment variables
   - `env.local` - Local environment (copied from testnet)
   - Network configuration set to testnet

2. **Deployment Scripts**
   - `scripts/deploy-testnet.sh` - Full deployment (requires build)
   - `scripts/deploy-testnet-simple.sh` - Simplified deployment
   - `scripts/build-with-docker.sh` - Docker-based build for Apple Silicon
   - `scripts/get-testnet-sol.sh` - Get testnet SOL
   - `scripts/setup-env.sh` - Environment setup

3. **Frontend Configuration**
   - Network indicator component
   - Wallet provider configured for testnet
   - Environment-aware configuration

## 🔧 Current Status

- ✅ Solana CLI: 1.18.20
- ✅ Anchor CLI: 0.31.1
- ✅ Environment: Configured for testnet
- ⚠️ Build: Requires x86_64 emulation (Apple Silicon limitation)

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Option 1: Quick Test (No Build)
```bash
# Use existing program ID for testing
./scripts/deploy-testnet-simple.sh

# Start frontend
npm run dev
```

### Option 2: Full Build & Deploy (Recommended)
```bash
# Get testnet SOL first
./scripts/get-testnet-sol.sh

# Build with Docker (x86_64 emulation)
./scripts/build-with-docker.sh

# Deploy to testnet
./scripts/deploy-testnet.sh

# Start frontend
npm run dev
```

### Option 3: Remote Build
- Use GitHub Actions or CI/CD
- Build on Linux/x86_64 server
- Download built binary

## 🌐 Testnet Configuration

- **Network**: Testnet
- **RPC URL**: https://api.testnet.solana.com
- **Explorer**: https://explorer.solana.com/?cluster=testnet
- **Faucet**: https://faucet.solana.com

## 📱 Frontend Features

- **Network Indicator**: Shows current network and provides faucet link
- **Wallet Integration**: Phantom, Solflare, Torus support
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile and desktop optimized
- **Real-time Updates**: Connection status monitoring

## 🔍 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Wallet connects to testnet
- [ ] Network indicator shows "Testnet"
- [ ] Faucet link works
- [ ] Program interactions work (if deployed)
- [ ] Error handling works properly

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No testnet SOL**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/get-testnet-sol.sh
   ```

2. **Build fails on Apple Silicon**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/build-with-docker.sh
   ```

3. **Environment not updated**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-env.sh
   ```

4. **Frontend won't start**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

### Environment Variables

Your `.env.local` should contain:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_NETWORK=testnet
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=https://api.testnet.solana.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_LAUNCHPAD_PROGRAM_ID=YOUR_PROGRAM_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_IS_TESTNET=true
```
