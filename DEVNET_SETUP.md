# Devnet Setup Complete! 🎉

## ✅ What's Working Now

- **Network**: Devnet (with 12 SOL available)
- **Frontend**: Running on http://localhost:3000
- **Program ID**: `8UvF1rHKk43GzFgtzLbtEQjVW6HyTZukfxyCDPziaMtH`
- **Environment**: Configured for devnet
- **Wallet**: Connected to devnet

## 🌐 Current Configuration

- **Network**: Devnet
- **RPC URL**: https://api.devnet.solana.com
- **Explorer**: https://explorer.solana.com/?cluster=devnet
- **Program ID**: 8UvF1rHKk43GzFgtzLbtEQjVW6HyTZukfxyCDPziaMtH

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Test the Frontend
- Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
- Connect your wallet (make sure it's set to devnet)
- Verify the network indicator shows "Devnet"
- Test wallet connection and basic functionality

### 2. Deploy Your Program (Optional)
Since you have SOL on devnet, you can now deploy your program:

```bash
# Try to build and deploy
./scripts/deploy-devnet.sh

# Or manually deploy if you have a pre-built binary
anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet
```

### 3. Test Program Interactions
After deployment, test:
- Creating launchpads
- Buying/selling tokens
- All other program functionality

## 🔧 Available Scripts

- `./scripts/deploy-devnet.sh` - Deploy to devnet
- `./scripts/build-simple.sh` - Try local build
- `./scripts/build-with-docker.sh` - Docker build (complex)

## 📱 Wallet Configuration

Make sure your wallet is connected to **devnet**:
- **Phantom**: Settings → Developer Settings → Change Network → Devnet
- **Solflare**: Settings → Networks → Add/Select Devnet

## 🎯 Success Metrics

- ✅ Frontend loads on devnet
- ✅ Wallet connects successfully
- ✅ Network indicator shows "Devnet"
- ✅ Program ID is configured
- ✅ Basic functionality works

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. **Check network**: Make sure wallet is on devnet
2. **Restart frontend**: `npm run dev`
3. **Verify balance**: `solana balance`
4. **Check config**: `solana config get`

## 🌟 You're All Set!

Your launchpad is now configured for devnet and ready for testing! The frontend will show the correct network status and you have sufficient SOL for deployment.
